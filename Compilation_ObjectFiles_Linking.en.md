# Quick guide about compilation, object files and linking

>NOTE: Although the examples that are going to be used in this guide are for the C language, it can be extrapolated to other programming languages that have a compiler.

## 1. Overview
There are (in most cases, discounting interpreted code) two stages in getting from source code (what you write, e.g. *.c* files) to executable code (what you run on PC, e.g. *.exe* or *.out*):

  1. First there is the **compilation**, which converts the source code, files written in a specific language; in object files (*.o*), binary files understandable for the type of computer/microchip that has been chosen.
  2. Then, linking, is what combines object modules together to form an executable.

## 3. Statically *vs* Dynamically linked libraries
